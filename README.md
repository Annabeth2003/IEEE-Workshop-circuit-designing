This is the Github repository to store the descirption and photos of the IEEE Workshop for basic electronics and analog circuit designing conducted by Mohammed Ayaz Quadri and Nihil Joshi in June 2023 in VJTI. Thank You!
I had the privilege of attending an amazing 2-Days Hands-on workshop titled "Basic Electronics and Analog Integrated Circuits" organized by IEEE VJTI and conducted by Mohammed Ayaz Quadri and Nihil Joshi on 27th and 28th June 2023.

The workshop was well instructed with thorough explanation of concepts and theory behind all the circuits we practically made.

My teammates, Chetana Talele and Amisha Sane, and I made many interesting and informative cirucits from scratch following the instructions of our mentors. The circuits were not only informative but also fun and exciting with use of lights and sounds which made the workshop even more interesting.

The circuits included were:
- Current Sources
- Current Mirrors
- Light control circuit using LDR and Op-Amp with no, positive and negative feedback
- Wien Bridge & Relaxation Oscillator
- Electronic Piano Toy with NE555
- 2-Stage Class AB Audio Amplifier using Op-Amp and BJT Push-Pull Stage
